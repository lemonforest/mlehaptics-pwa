# MLEHaptics PWA - Configuration Service

Progressive Web App for configuring MLEHaptics BLE devices for EMDR therapy.

## Features

### BLE Configuration Service (AD032 Compliant)

This PWA implements the complete BLE Configuration Service architecture as defined in AD032:

#### Motor Control
- **Preset Modes**: 5 predefined motor patterns (1Hz/0.5Hz @ 50%/25%, Custom)
- **Custom Frequency**: 0.25-2.0 Hz research range (adjustable in 0.01 Hz increments)
- **Custom Duty Cycle**: 10-90% perceptible range
- **PWM Intensity**: 30-80% motor power safety limits

#### LED Control
- **Dual Mode System**:
  - **Palette Mode**: 16 preset colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, etc.)
  - **Custom RGB Mode**: Full-spectrum color wheel (0-255 per channel)
- **Brightness Control**: 10-30% eye strain prevention range
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle LED on/off

#### Status & Monitoring
- **Session Duration**: Configurable 20-90 minute target sessions
- **Real-time Progress**: Live elapsed time tracking via BLE notifications
- **Battery Monitoring**: Real-time battery level (0-100%) with alerts
- **Auto-save**: All settings persist to device NVS storage

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** - Modern UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Material-UI (MUI)** - Professional component library
- **Vite** - Fast build tool with HMR
- **Web Bluetooth API** - Direct BLE communication
- **PWA** - Offline-first architecture with service workers

## Requirements

### Browser Support

Web Bluetooth API is required. Supported browsers:
- Chrome (desktop and Android)
- Microsoft Edge
- Opera

**Note**: Safari does not currently support Web Bluetooth API.

### Device Requirements

- MLEHaptics device with Configuration Service (UUID: `6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`)
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support
- Device must advertise the Configuration Service

### Security

- **HTTPS Required**: Web Bluetooth requires secure contexts (HTTPS in production)
- **User Gesture**: Connection must be initiated by user action (button click)

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will start on `https://localhost:5173` (HTTPS required for Web Bluetooth).

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized PWA will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Usage

1. **Connect Device**
   - Click "Connect Device" in the top-right corner
   - Select your MLEHaptics device from the browser's Bluetooth pairing dialog
   - Device name will appear once connected

2. **Configure Motor Settings**
   - Select a preset mode or choose "Custom" for advanced control
   - Adjust frequency (0.25-2.0 Hz) and duty cycle (10-90%) in custom mode
   - Set PWM intensity (30-80%) for motor power

3. **Configure LED Settings**
   - Toggle LED on/off
   - Choose color mode: Palette (16 presets) or Custom RGB (full spectrum)
   - Adjust brightness (10-30%) for comfort

4. **Monitor Session**
   - Set target session duration (20-90 minutes)
   - Track real-time progress and elapsed time
   - Monitor battery level with low-battery alerts

5. **Automatic Saving**
   - All changes are immediately written to the device
   - Settings persist across device power cycles via NVS storage

## Architecture

### BLE Service Implementation

The app implements AD032's Configuration Service with all 12 characteristics:

```typescript
Service UUID: 6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E

Motor Control (4 characteristics):
- 6E400102: Mode (uint8, R/W)
- 6E400202: Custom Frequency (uint16, R/W)
- 6E400302: Custom Duty Cycle (uint8, R/W)
- 6E400402: PWM Intensity (uint8, R/W)

LED Control (5 characteristics):
- 6E400502: LED Enable (uint8, R/W)
- 6E400602: LED Color Mode (uint8, R/W)
- 6E400702: LED Palette Index (uint8, R/W)
- 6E400802: LED Custom RGB (uint8[3], R/W)
- 6E400902: LED Brightness (uint8, R/W)

Status/Monitoring (3 characteristics):
- 6E400A02: Session Duration (uint32, R/W)
- 6E400B02: Session Time (uint32, R/Notify)
- 6E400C02: Battery Level (uint8, R/Notify)
```

### PWA Features

- **Offline Support**: Service worker caches assets for offline use
- **Installable**: Can be installed as a standalone app on mobile/desktop
- **Responsive**: Works on phones, tablets, and desktop browsers
- **Fast**: Optimized build with code splitting and lazy loading

## Troubleshooting

### "Web Bluetooth is not supported"
- Use Chrome, Edge, or Opera browser
- Safari does not support Web Bluetooth
- Ensure you're using a recent browser version

### "Connection failed"
- Ensure device is powered on and within range
- Check that device is advertising the Configuration Service
- Try refreshing the page and reconnecting
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### "HTTPS required"
- Web Bluetooth only works over HTTPS in production
- Development servers must use HTTPS (Vite config includes this)
- Use `localhost` in development (automatically secure context)

### Settings not persisting
- Check that device firmware implements NVS storage
- Verify write operations complete successfully in browser console
- Ensure device has sufficient NVS flash space

## Development

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Type Checking

TypeScript will check types during build. For manual checking:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```
